		<text id="sub_tip3">The [object=sub] can carry more weight than you can, but it still has a limit. Check the [object=sub]'s inventory by hitting [key=inventory], as it can't move if overweight.</text>
		<text id="sub_tip4">Did you know you can use hotkeys to repair the [object=sub]? Just set [item=titanium] to a hotkey and use it while riding the [object=sub]!</text>
		<text id="make_ship_parts">If you need more [item=ship_parts], I upgraded the [color=770000]Factory[/color] to be able to manufacture them. The process is inefficient with our current technology, but it could be helpful!</text>
		<text id="build_com1">I wonder if we could use [item=ship_parts] to contact Earth and the other colony worlds... maybe see if there are other survivors out there?</text>
		<text id="build_com2">Awesome! Once you have [item=ship_parts], head to the highest mountain you can then give me a call and we can set it up!</text>

		<text id="build_com4">... and that should do it! Unfortunately, I gotta jet, but give it a try and see if you can find anyone!</text>
		<text id="build_com5">That's a great location for the [color=770000]Com Station[/color]! Just bring the [item=ship_parts] there and we can set it up!</text>

		<text id="com_station6">But some of the colony worlds must have survived! If we can input their coordinates into the [color=770000]Com Station[/color], we can search for signals!</text>

		<text id="bombardment">Those [object=mirrows] think this bunker will last for years, but not without lots of maintenance! Of course they don't offer to help me keep everything up and running!</text>
		<text id="bombardment2">I can't believe they bombed their own planet! We're all okay though, we're hiding in the [color=770000]Colony Ship[/color]'s cargo area.</text>

		<text id="research2">I'm not sure how much help I'll be with research, but I'll definitely do my best to keep this ship running smoothly!</text>
		<text id="research_lab">You built a [color=770000]Mobile Research Lab[/color]? I might not be a great researcher, but if you bring it closer I'll board it and make sure it's in tip top condition!</text>
		<text id="win1">The war is won, but if humanity is to survive, we need to bring all the survivors together and hope there’s enough of us left that we won’t die out!</text>
		<text id="win2">Try using the [color=770000]Com Station[/color] on The Heights to locate other colony worlds!</text>
		<text id="win3">I think we’re going to thrive here! A few more years, and this will become the new capital of humanity as we spread out across the stars once more!</text>
		<text id="win4">It’s been a lot of work, but this colony is starting to resemble a real human city with all of the modern amenities!</text>
		<text id="win5">We’ve even set up a shuttle service to transport stranded survivors to this planet. If you meet anyone, make sure to tell them about it!</text>

		<text id="airport2">The [color=770000]Airport[/color] will allow you to build [object=jet]s. While they can't reach outer space, they can fly pretty high and will make getting around a lot easier!</text>
		<text id="spaceship1">If we want to repair the spaceship, we'll need a lot more [item=ship_parts]... and some [item=power_core]s too. See what you can find with the [object=sub].</text>
		<text id="build_sub1">Ah, you built the [object=sub]! When riding the [object=sub], hit [key=equipment] to repair, recharge and customize it!</text>
		<text id="build_sub2">You might want to install a weapon system like the [item=torpedo_launcher] too, otherwise you'll be defenseless! Hit [key=attack] to fire the installed weapon.</text>
		<text id="sub_empty1">I got a signal that the [object=sub] is out of juice! Hopefully you have some [item=battery default=Batteries].</text>
		<text id="sub_empty2">You can restore the [object=sub]'s power by hitting [key=equipment] and then selecting [tile=battery.ico] Charge from Batteries.</text>
		<text id="sub1">You sound like you're lost. Try returning to the Water Cave, we can guide you to the [item=ship_parts] from there.</text>
		<text id="sub2">Based on the water currents, the [item=ship_parts] should have traveled west. Keep heading west and see if you can find anything.</text>
		<text id="sub3">You found another island? Then the [item=ship_parts] may have washed ashore there... or perhaps they entered a cave. Check around for any underwater cave entrances.</text>
		<text id="sub4">You found an underwater cave? That sounds very promising, I bet the [item=ship_parts] ended up there!</text>
		<text id="sub5">Be careful though, underwater caves like that can be dangerous and unpredictable. Keep an eye out for caverns where you can restore your [tile=oxygen] [color=ffffff]Oxygen[/color].</text>
		<text id="mirrow_same_room">You realize we're right here... right?</text>
		<text id="mirrow_power_core">You found [item=power_core_parts]? Keep track of those, we may be able to build a [item=power_core] which will let us power the spaceship.</text>
		<text id="ship_parts1">You found the [item=ship_parts]? Excellent! Return to the Sunset Haven cave, we've already come up with something to make use of the [item=ship_parts]!</text>
		<text id="ship_parts2">Or you could explore a bit more, perhaps there is more to find out west.</text>
		<text id="ship_parts3">We're improving the lab to better utilize the [item=ship_parts] you found. Make yourself useful and keep searching for other debris out west.</text>
		<text id="escort_ship1">You found the wreckage of an escort ship? That would be a lot smaller and easier to repair than the [color=770000]Colony Ship[/color]!</text>
		<text id="escort_ship2">Bring us some [item=ship_parts], and then we'll take a look at the wreckage!</text>
		<text id="escort_ship3">We're on our way to survey the damage, meet us there. This could be a major breakthrough!</text>
		<text id="escort_ship4">Well, what are we waiting for? We must head there immediately! Prep the [object=jet]!</text>
		<text id="escort_ship5">It looks bad, but we can work with this. It'll need a lot of [item=ship_parts] to repair though!</text>
		<text id="escort_ship6">Excellent! Give us a call when you have everything!</text>
		<text id="escort_ship7">I said to give us a call once you had EVERYTHING! If you forgot what we need to repair the ship, check your quest log with [key=quest].</text>
		<text id="escort_ship8">The relocation of the lab is pretty much finished. Now we just need those parts to repair the ship, and we'll really be going places!</text>
		<text id="escort_ship9">The spaceship will need a [item=power_core] to fly, but try entering it and checking out all the systems - especially the control room!</text>
		<text id="escort_power_core1">You could create a [item=power_core] from [item=power_core_parts] in an [color=770000]Advanced Laboratory[/color], but that section of the [color=770000]Colony Ship[/color] broke off.</text>
		<text id="escort_power_core2">Perhaps enough of it is intact somewhere for the [object=mechanic] to repair it?</text>
		<text id="escort_ship10">You got everything? Perfect, let's see if this ship can still be repaired! Meet us at the crash site!</text>
		<text id="escort_ship11">Well look at that! It looks as good as new, and ready to launch into space!</text>
		<text id="escort_ship12">It's quite the accomplishment! It won't be able to defeat them without weapons, but it sure gives us options!</text>
		<text id="ride_back">We're heading back to the water cave, do you want a ride?</text>
		<text id="ride_water_cave">Do you want us to pick you up and fly you to the water cave?</text>
		<text id="jet_door">The door leads to a launch pad for the [object=mirrows] private [object=jet].</text>
		<text id="jet_door2">No, I shouldn't steal their [object=jet], as tempting as that sounds.</text>
		<text id="jet_door3">Now that the [object=mirrows] are gone, I guess this [object=jet] belongs to Cass...</text>
		<text id="jet_door4">There's no one left who can claim this [object=jet]... it was a long and hard journey, but the time has finally come to steal it!</text>
		<text id="boring_machine">Why are you building boring machines? We have much more important things to do right now!</text>
		<text id="ship_bed">Ah, do you want to try our amazing rejuvenation pod? If you pay 50 [color=770000][tile=coin_purse.ico] Coins[/color] for the energy cost, we'll let you.</text>
		<text id="no_money">But you don't have 50 [color=770000][tile=coin_purse.ico] Coins[/color]... Maybe try selling some junk at the [color=770000]Market[/color], that's what we do when we're strapped for cash!</text>
		<text id="blueprints1">We need more funds for our research, so we decided to start selling inventions and [tile=blueprint.ico] [color=770000]Blueprint[/color]s!</text>
		<text id="blueprints2">All sales go towards a good cause. Make sure to come back, as anytime we invent something new we'll add it to the store!</text>
		<text id="blueprints3">Feel free to stop by the {area} and check out what we have!</text>
		<text id="bombardment1">They came too soon! We knew this was coming and tried to prepare, but we just didn't have enough time!</text>
		<text id="bombardment2">I'm certain this is only their first wave - we'll need to act fast to destroy their bomber before the second wave arrives!</text>
		<text id="bombardment3">To destroy the bomber, we'll first need a spaceship, and we'll also need some powerful weapons. It won't be easy, but perhaps with your help we can do something!</text>
		<text id="bombardment4">We have strengthened the hull and this cargo hold has enough fresh food and water to hold out for years... but if we can't do something about that bombardment, it will all be for nothing.</text>
		<text id="bombardment5">You have defeated the enemy bomber!? Then we have time until the next wave arrives, but we must act fast!</text>
		<text id="bombardment6">We have finally completed our secret weapon! It is a spaceship we cobbled together using spare [item=ship_parts] with an experimental weapon that should be able to take down their shields!</text>
		<text id="bombardment7">We haven't had time to test it, but we must end the bombardment soon or their reinforcements will arrive! Unless you have a better plan, we will launch now!</text>
		<text id="bombardment8">Very well - but act fast! If you change your mind, simply talk to us again!</text>
		<text id="sacrifice1">This clunker actually made it into space! The enemy bomber is in our sights, now to test out this new weapon!</text>
		<text id="sacrifice2">We'll only have one chance at this - I'll take down the enemy shields, and then hit it with everything we have!</text>
		<text id="sacrifice3">If we miss...[pause=1] or don't make it back...[pause=1] it'll be up to you to protect everyone.[pause=1] And tell Cass...[pause=1] Nevermind...</text>
		<text id="sacrifice4">I know we didn't always see eye to eye, but I hope this attack shows you that the only way to survive is power!</text>
		<text id="sacrifice5">That's enough chatting - we better attack it before it notices us! Mirrows, signing out!</text>
		<text id="sacrifice6">Mirrows! Come in! Can you read me! What happened up there!?</text>
		<text id="sacrifice7">The signal is lost. They didn't make it...</text>
		<text id="send_mirrows">Use Mirrow's Plan</text>
		<text id="have_plan">Defeat Bomber Yourself</text>
		<text id="research1">Incredible! This is the perfect place to advance our research! I will have to thank this [object=professor] for designing this superb mobile laboratory.</text>
		<text id="research2">The only thing it is missing is a [color=770000]Surgery Lab[/color]! But, there is room in here to build one (or even two)! I trust you'll make good use of the [item=operation_table_blueprint].</text>
		<text id="research3">It even has a [color=770000]Surgery Lab[/color]! Everything we could want in one, compact, mobile package!</text>
		<text id="on_bomber">... you should probably leave the enemy bomber before we try to destroy it! Let us know when you're safely away from it, and then call us again!</text>
		<text id="research_lab">You built a [color=770000]Mobile Research Lab[/color]?! Well, what are you waiting for, bring it closer so we can board it!</text>
		<text id="cyborg1">The colonists seem to think [item=exotic_matter] is the solution to everything... but don't underestimate the power of cybernetic enhancements!</text>
		<text id="cyborg2">We've discovered a new kind of [item=carapace] on the colony world's surface, and with it and some research funds, we should be able to invent powerful cyborg upgrades!</text>
		<text id="cyborg3">Excellent! We knew we could count on you! This [item=carapace] is perfect for binding man and machine without any rejection or loss!</text>
		<text id="cyborg4">The research is finished, and you can find the new equipment in the [color=770000]Surgery Lab[/color]!</text>
		<text id="com_device">Did Cass give you that [item=com_device]? We have one too, let me add us to your contacts in case you want to talk to us!</text>
		<text id="win1">The war is won?! I hope our cyborg enhancements were useful in the final battle!</text>
		<text id="win2">What should we do now? We can’t possibly give up on our cyborg research just because the war is over!</text>
		<text id="win3">Very true. We’ll just have to prepare for the next war! Whether it’s with humans or aliens, you can be sure there will always be another!</text>
		<text id="werewolf1">Fascinating - this [object=unnature.splicer] must be a master of manipulating genomes! You don’t even appear to be human anymore!</text>
		<text id="werewolf2">If you were expecting help from us, you’ll be disappointed. We are not veterinarians, our expertise is with human cyborgification!</text>

		<text id="intro8">If I can. But I’m not as young as I once was. I can’t even remember the last time I left this island.</text>
		<text id="cultivator1">On the main island to the east, there is the [color=770000]Cultivator[/color]. Without their magic, it has gone mad and is wreaking havoc.</text>

		<text id="cultivator3">I recommend using fire against it. I would help you myself, were it not so hard to fly... and breathe fire.</text>
		<text id="cultivator4">This is magnificent. Now that the [color=770000]Vine Copse[/color] has been revived, transformation magic - the type of magic that sustains dragon-kind - will spread through the land once again.</text>

		<text id="betrayal3">But eventually they changed. They stopped helping us grow and started using us to achieve their own goals, forcing us into servitude.</text>
		<text id="betrayal4">And then they abandoned us when we outlived our usefulness, taking their magic secrets with them. No longer can we evolve, and the last of the dragons are dying out.</text>
		<text id="betrayal5">I’ve spent the past millenia cursing their names and trying to learn magic to help the [item=wyrm]s myself.</text>
		<text id="betrayal6">If all I can do at this age is help you exterminate them, I will do so willingly!</text>
		<text id="betrayal7">I never said anything about exterminating them, only surviving!</text>
		<text id="betrayal8">Oh.[pause=1] Well, keep it in mind if the opportunity arises!</text>
		<text id="fish_village1">Normally, I eat fish without listening to their screams. But sometimes I use my translation magic for fun, and I heard something that may be useful.</text>

		<text id="ship1">You have made an [item=evo_gem]? That is how they made us into [object=fly_ancient_dragon]s! Simply use the evolution gem on an [item=adult_dragon]!</text>
		<text id="ship2">Once you have raised an [object=fly_ancient_dragon], the next step is to evolve it into a [color=770000]Dragon Ship[/color] at the top of the large floating island to the east called [color=770000]Dragon Island[/color].</text>
		<text id="ship2.1">Unfortunately, [color=770000]Dragon Island[/color] is guarded by a dangerous ice monster. Only powerful [color=770000][tile=fire.ico] Fire[/color] magic will harm it.</text>
		<text id="ship3">While they created [color=770000]Dragon Ships[/color] millenia ago and are sure to have something more powerful now, this could be the first step towards defeating them!</text>
		<text id="ship4">Once they learned our potential for becoming organic spaceships, they no longer treated us as sentient beings, but instead as machines for turning into their fleet.</text>
		<text id="ship5">They began to seek ultimate power, and no longer cared about trying to help us like they once had.</text>
		<text id="ship6">I gave you the secret of [color=770000]Dragon Ships[/color] willingly so that we could fight them… please don’t abuse us the same way they did.</text>
		<text id="ship7">You have done it? Then I have given you all the help I can - I know no more of their ships or magic.</text>
		<text id="ship8">I would join you in the fight, but I was never able to turn into a [color=770000]Dragon Ship[/color]. Besides, it is the job of the elderly to send the young off on perilous quests rife with danger, no?</text>
		<text id="ship9">The Exiled thinks that you can help me. I’m trying to discover their magical secrets.</text>
		<text id="ship10">You would listen to one of them and discover their secrets!? Well, I do owe you a debt, so I will tell you what I know.</text>
		<text id="ship11">They used to use [item=evo_gem]s to evolve us into [color=770000]Dragon Ships[/color] at the top of the large floating island to the east called [color=770000]Dragon Island[/color].</text>
		<text id="ship12">Perhaps this secret will help you - I can only hope that you will not abuse us the same way they did.</text>
		<text id="win1">You have defeated them?! Vengeance is fulfilled! Then why do I feel so empty? It must just be old age...</text>
		<text id="win2">You defeated them? Then I owe you a debt of gratitude after they betrayed me and my kind!</text>
		<text id="dragon_backpack">But now that you know how to create [color=770000]Dragon Ships[/color], you should be able to use an [item=alter_gem] on a packed up [item=ancient_dragon] to create a [item=dragon_backpack].</text>

		<text id="welcome1">Hello there!</text>
		<text id="welcome2">Hi…[pause=1] wait. Your mouth wasn’t moving! How are you talking?!</text>
		<text id="welcome3">We're communicating telepathically of course! What other way is there to communicate?</text>
		<text id="welcome4">Uh... Right... So you're reading my mind?</text>
		<text id="welcome5">Surface thoughts only! It's bad etiquette to read a mind too deeply!</text>
		<text id="citizen1">What a pleasant surprise - we rarely see outsiders here!</text>
		<text id="citizen2">We have lived here since time immemorial, before the Old Ones, before the others, and before the dragons.</text>
		<text id="citizen3">No one thinks much of us. And that’s okay. We're safe down here and we like it that way!</text>
		<text id="citizen4">Pardon me if I'm assuming incorrectly, but you breathe air, yes?</text>
		<text id="citizen5">You should really craft a [item=water_helm] if you want to hang around down here! Here, I can give you the recipe!</text>
		<text id="citizen6">There's also a cave to the west that we blocked off with magic so it has air if you need it!</text>
		<text id="recipe">You telepathically learned the following recipe:\n{enchant} + {items} = {creates}.</text>
		<text id="merchant1">Greetings, traveler. Welcome to my humble supply shop.</text>
		<text id="merchant2">I assume you don’t have any fish currency - but that is okay. I accept most forms of currency, as long as it has value.</text>
		<text id="merchant3">You use bits of metal mined from underground? Strange, but [color=770000][tile=coin_purse.ico] Coins[/color] certainly have value, and you are a land creature, so perhaps it makes sense.</text>
		<text id="coin_purse">Here's a purse I had lying around you can use to carry [color=770000][tile=coin_purse.ico] Coins[/color]!</text>
		<text id="merchant4">I've been researching the magical properties of sea creatures and coral. If you could catch a live [item=scale_fish], I think I'll be able to make something valuable.</text>
		<text id="merchant5">I have done it! I have invented the [color=770000]Coral Pen[/color]! It can harvest magical materials from creatures like [item=scale_fish], and will make restocking much easier!</text>
		<text id="merchant6">I added [item=coral_pen_seed]s to my store. Buy a few and see what you think!</text>
		<text id="merchant7">[item=scale_fish] are tough to catch, but if you injure them and use a [item=water_trap], you should be able to catch one.</text>
		<text id="merchant8">Our underwater trade routes were once flowing with gems, potions, and magical ingredients. Now, we are so few - and all hidden away in quiet spots like this one, there is barely a trade route to speak of.</text>
		<text id="merchant9">Nevertheless! We still prosper, for the sea floor is abundant.</text>
		<text id="merchant10">Have you built many [color=770000]Coral Pen[/color]s? I was trying to figure out a way to manage them more efficiently, and came up with a new coral structure - the [color=770000]Coral Farm[/color]!</text>
		<text id="merchant11">You can now buy [item=coral_farm_seed]s in the store. Plant them, and you will be able to access and harvest all the [color=770000]Coral Pen[/color]s and [color=770000]Wyrm Pen[/color]s on the same island!</text>
		<text id="librarian1">I am the village librarian, curator of spellbooks!</text>
		<text id="librarian2">Unlike some… well, others… we enjoy sharing our knowledge!</text>
		<text id="librarian3">You are welcome to use our library to learn how to create spellbooks of your own!</text>
		<text id="librarian4">Unlike other forms of magic, spellbooks channel the power within you.</text>
		<text id="librarian5">At first, this will tire you out quickly, but if you gain skill in [color=770000][tile=stat.spellcast] Spellcasting[/color], you’ll be able to cast many more spells without resting.</text>
		<text id="librarian6">Spells can be very powerful, but they also take time to cast. Be careful about when and where you use them - if you are attacked while casting the spell, it will be cancelled.</text>
		<text id="librarian7">Always remember - magic is only a tool - it is up to the one using the tool that determines its value. Do not hate magic because of what they have done with it.</text>
		<text id="librarian8">Magic is the art of change. It can change a simple item into a powerful force. And the more you use magic, the more it changes YOU.</text>
		<text id="librarian9">Once, our villages sprawled across the vastness of this sea. Now, we hide in this quiet little nook of the ocean floor, content to keep to ourselves and avoid the hostilities of the universe.</text>
		<text id="librarian10">Some of our ancestors ventured out of the sea and changed themselves, using the magic of the depths to propel themselves into the skies. Now, they are the enemy of many.</text>
		<text id="librarian11">We do not fear them, but we do regret the path they have taken - one of secrecy and jealousy.</text>
		<text id="revitalize1">An [object=ancient_dragon_npc] is helping you create a [color=770000]Dragon Ship[/color]? I never thought I’d hear that! Then again, we don’t hear much down here.</text>
		<text id="revitalize2">But the [color=770000]Dragon Ship Factory[/color] is guarded by a very powerful ice monster! Is there any way you could help me defeat it?</text>
		<text id="revitalize3">Well, if it’s made of [color=770000][tile=ice.ico] Ice[/color], the [item=fire_book] should be able to hurt it. Your [object=ancient_dragon_npc] friend could defeat it as well if it was imbued with the power of a [item=horn].</text>
		<text id="revitalize4">But the [object=ancient_dragon_npc] can barely fly!</text>
		<text id="revitalize5">Ah, well old age gets us all in the end. But, there is a special potion that can revitalize the elderly for a short period of time. If you can gather the ingredients, I will create it for you.</text>
		<text id="revitalize6">You have all the ingredients? Here is the potion - give it to the [object=ancient_dragon_npc] and see if that helps him! I'll add the recipe for the potion to your laboratory in case you need to make more.</text>
		<text id="revitalize7">What is this potion? I feel like I can do anything! I could even finally become a [color=770000]Dragon Ship[/color] myself!</text>
		<text id="revitalize8">That bout of invincibility didn’t last long. Still old and frail. But, at least I burned that ice monster to a crisp! That’s the most fun I’ve had in ages - literally!</text>
		<text id="potion1">Ahh, so you met the [object=sea_witch]? She used to live down here with us, but decided to go ashore to learn the secret of immortality.</text>
		<text id="potion2">The nerve! Following in their footsteps after everything I taught her! But... I can't well deny you the knowledge. I'll add the recipe for the potion to your laboratory!</text>
		<text id="potion3">Ah, well old age gets us all in the end. But maybe try that [item=revitalize_potion] I taught you for the [object=sea_witch] - it should help your dragon friend too! The recipe should still be in your laboratory.</text>
		<text id="sea_witch1">What strange times... they might be returning and the [object=sea_witch] has returned to the sea...</text>
		<text id="sea_witch2">Of course, we had to accept her back with open arms. She even taught me what she learned on the surface, and I created several new spells! Check out the library, there are many new spellbooks now!</text>
		<text id="sea_witch3">What strange times... they have been defeated and the [object=sea_witch] has returned to the sea...</text>
		<text id="sushi1">You look hungry... I bet you could go for some [item=sushi]. I could just give you some, but you know the saying... teach a man to fish...</text>
		<text id="sushi2">If you fish up the ingredients, I'll show you how to make it!</text>
		<text id="sushi3">Excellent! Watch carefully - I make [item=sushi] quickly!</text>
		<text id="sushi4">And it's done! Enjoy it while it's fresh, and feel free to make your own!</text>
		<text id="exiled1">I have taught you everything I know about magic. Only one of them would be able to teach you more.</text>
		<text id="exiled2">But… perhaps there is one who would help you. Seek out The Exiled on the planet you call Mars.</text>

		<text id="intro2">I've been researching the enemy ships. They are nothing like our technology! At first, I thought they used advanced biotech, but the more I study, the more I believe they operate under completely different principles from what we know and understand.</text>
		<text id="intro3">Just look at the mountain of ice above my lab, who could've guessed that fragments of the enemy ships would create such a thing? Completely boggles the mind. I'm almost tempted to call it magic! The scientific community would laugh if they heard me say that. Not that there's a community left to laugh at me!</text>
		<text id="intro4">I'm sorry, am I rambling? This research is all I have, so you shouldn't be surprised that I can talk about it forever. Unfortunately, the more I understand about them, the more questions arise! I'm no closer to a breakthrough, and it seems like the human race is doomed already.</text>

It's not all doom and gloom, is it? I have discovered some things. And, I was just thinking about building a better research lab!</text>

They are essential for a transforming, all purpose laboratory vehicle!</text>
		<text id="hq1">It's time to put this research lab to use! I wasn't able to figure out much about their organic spaceship technology, but I bet I could invent a locator that could detect their presence anywhere in the galaxy. I'm sure that information will come in handy, especially when we're ready to take the fight to them!</text>
		<text id="hq2">I added the [item=alien_locator] to the research lab - you can manage research projects by hitting Z to operate the lab. The more researchers we have, the faster research will go, so if there's anyone else you can think of who could help, invite them aboard the lab!</text>
		<text id="hq3">Excellent! As long as the [item=alien_locator] is in your inventory or your ship's inventory, an indicator will show up next to planets that have alien technology present.</text>
		<text id="hq4">Hmm... something is strange here... The [item=alien_locator] is getting a strong signal from a star that has no planets. I added it to the star nav map, perhaps we should check it out?</text>

		<text id="rescue1">Thank the stars, we got to you in time! When we heard the Professor was still alive and planning to raid the enemy HQ, we knew we had to come immediately!</text>
		<text id="rescue2">Err... this might be rude, but are you a robot?</text>
		<text id="rescue3">Indeed! I am CaptAIn, the autonomous leader of the last major colony of mankind, installed to manage the survival of all humans and lead the war effort!</text>
		<text id="rescue4">An entire colony survived?! That is great news! And you're here to help us defeat them once and for all?</text>
		<text id="rescue5">No! We're here to rescue you! Their HQ is sealed off - we tried to breach it before and met with utter disaster!</text>
		<text id="rescue6">There is nothing we can do here, at present! But, with our resources and the Professor's help, it's only a matter of time before we crack that egg!</text>
		<text id="rescue6.2">I hate to give you bad news, but the Professor went down with the [color=770000]Mobile Research Lab[/color].</text>
		<text id="rescue6.3">That is unfortunate, but we'll have to make it work.</text>
		<text id="rescue7">Quick, follow us, we'll lead you to the colony world!</text>
		<text id="exo_fighter1">That battery-sucking no good [object=president]! I can't believe it won't issue me a new [item=exo_fighter]!</text>
		<text id="exo_fighter2">Just because I lost two already, it deemed me unfit to fly! Unfit to fly! Sure, I might have taken a few risks, but how many enemy fighters did I take down in the process? Hmm?</text>
		<text id="exo_fighter3">Hey! You're that kid from one of the refugee ships who built spaceships with nothing but a stone axe, and tried to take on enemy HQ alone! Right?</text>
		<text id="exo_fighter_alt1">That battery-sucking no good [object=president]! He banned me from flying, and now the war’s over! How can I be an ace pilot without a ship or war?!</text>
		<text id="exo_fighter_alt2">Hey! You're that kid from one of the refugee ships that single-handedly took down the enemy HQ with nothing but a stone axe! Right?</text>

		<text id="exo_fighter5">It's perfect! I knew I could count on you, kid! I'll board the [item=exo_fighter] now, just select it in your inventory and choose [color=770000]Talk[/color] if you need something!</text>
		<text id="exo_fighter6">I knew I could count on you! If you need help building an [item=exo_fighter], try talking to [object=president], it invented them! Once you've built one, you can pack it up to bring it to me by boarding it and hitting [key=equipment]!</text>

		<text id="weapons">Ask about Exo Weapons</text>
		<text id="colony">Ask about Colony World</text>
		<text id="alien_hq">Ask about Enemy HQ</text>
		<text id="exotic_matter">Ask about Exotic Matter</text>
		<text id="weapons1">If we are to win this war, we'll need very powerful weapons, and for that, we'll need to use [item=exotic_matter]. [text=colony.weapons1_alt]</text>
		<text id="weapons1_alt">I have already invented an [color=770000]Exo Factory[/color], a structure capable of building [item=exo_fighter]s, [item=exo_mech]s and [item=exo_drill]s.</text>
		<text id="weapons2">You can print the [item=exo_factory_blueprint] from any [color=770000]Blueprint Printer[/color] - I have one here if you need it. I have also sent all data I have on [item=exotic_matter] to the [color=770000]Mobile Research Lab[/color].</text>
		<text id="weapons3">Try researching new weapons in the [color=770000]Mobile Research Lab[/color], when research completes, it will be automatically added to the [color=770000]Exo Factory[/color]'s crafting list!</text>
		<text id="weapons4">Once we have a stockpile of weapons and [item=exotic_matter], and we've found a way to breach the enemy HQ, we will finally be ready to defeat them once and for all, and save all of humanity!</text>
		<text id="colony1">The Colony Ship got to this planet years ago on a mission to colonize new worlds. The planet had breathable air, but it was not very fertile and had a harsh climate.</text>
		<text id="colony2">The colonists scavenged parts from the ship to build a terraformer, and refurbished the rest as a station to oversee the terraforming, which slowly made the planet more hospitable.</text>
		<text id="colony3">The terraforming was stalled when the colonists heard about the attack and then lost contact with Earth, redirecting their efforts to the defense of this world from the unknown threat.</text>
		<text id="colony4">You are welcome to print the [item=terraformer_blueprint] from any [color=770000]Blueprint Printer[/color] if you want to experiment - it will add oxygen to oxygen-less planets and transform some non-fertile tiles into fertile tiles.</text>
		<text id="alien_hq1">The enemy HQ is protected by incredibly strong wings that only open to release newly built enemy ships. We've tried pushing through while the wings were open, but they are able to close too quickly.</text>
		<text id="alien_hq2">We then tried drilling through the wings, but even the newly invented [item=exo_drill] was not strong enough. Somehow, we need to force the wings to stay open long enough for a ship to slip through.</text>
		<text id="alien_hq3">No one knows what is inside the wings, but since the HQ is organic, it must have some sort of heart controlling it. Breach the wings, defeat the heart, end their ability to wage war, and the war is won.</text>
		<text id="alien_hq4">It sounds quite easy when I put it that way, doesn't it!</text>
		<text id="exotic_matter1">Everyone knows [item=exotic_matter] allows FTL travel and accepts this as a normal part of life. But, how many people know why?</text>
		<text id="exotic_matter2">The answer is NONE! When [item=exotic_matter] was discovered, physicists couldn't understand what it was, and so gave it to AI to analyze. What the AIs discovered shocked the world, and started World War 3!</text>
		<text id="exotic_matter3">Faster than light travel! Perpetual motion machines! Seemingly infinite power! A seemingly magical resource that everyone in the world wanted. What other magical properties could [item=exotic_matter] hold?</text>
		<text id="exotic_matter4">When I was installed as the leader of this colony and the war effort, I immediately put all remaining AIs to answering that question. And in doing so, the [color=770000]Exo Factory[/color], [item=exo_fighter] and [item=exo_mech] were invented!</text>
		<text id="virus1">We have come to the conclusion that the best way to open the wings defending the enemy HQ is to develop a virus. No matter how strong they are, they are organic tissue and should be susceptible.</text>
		<text id="virus2">We'll need some [item=alien_heart]s as samples to develop the virus. If you board their ships and kill their crew, you should be able to harvest plenty of them.</text>
		<text id="virus3">We'll also need a new [item=exo_drill] to dig down to the enemy HQ's heart once the wings have been breached. Could you gather these materials while we continue our research?</text>
		<text id="virus4">This is exactly what we need to complete the virus! We'll finish the virus and ready our fleet for the assault. Once you're prepared, head to to Enemy HQ and we'll meet you there!</text>
		<text id="virus5">The virus is ready and installed into the missile you can see on the holoscreen. Once it hits the wings, it should infect them and cause the muscles to relax and open - allowing us to enter.</text>
		<text id="virus6">However, we have a small problem. The [color=770000]Enemy Cruiser[/color] can shoot down our missiles, so as long as it is in orbit, we cannot complete the plan.</text>
		<text id="virus7">Our fleet will assist you as best it can. Once the [color=770000]Enemy Cruiser[/color] is destroyed or disabled, we will launch the missile and begin the assault!</text>
		<text id="virus8">The virus has been deployed! Our fleet will keep the enemy fleet distracted as long as it can - but it will be up to you to enter the HQ!</text>
		<text id="virus9">When the wings open, descend to the HQ, use the [item=exo_drill] to dig all the way down to the HQ's heart, and defeat the enemy once and for all!</text>
		<text id="nursery_enter">This looks to be the enemy nursery! That crab creature appears to both protect and nurture their hatchlings - kill it, and they should all die out!</text>
		<text id="nursery_defeat1">You've defeated the enemy nursery? Excellent. You did the right thing - this will ensure that they are extinguished as a threat not just now, but forever.</text>
		<text id="nursery_defeat2">Now you just need to defeat the heart of the HQ, and the war is won! Dig all the way down, and you should find it!</text>
		<text id="nursery_defeat3">Now you can leave the [color=770000]Enemy HQ[/color] knowing that the war is won, and humanity's survival is ensured!</text>
		<text id="boss_defeat1">I overheard your conversation. You aren't actually considering sparing the hatchlings, are you?</text>
		<text id="boss_defeat2">Think about the future of humanity! Even though you defeated the heart, as long as they live, they could rebuild and become a threat again.</text>
		<text id="boss_defeat3">If the HQ is really going to seal itself off, you MUST defeat the nursery now, before it's too late.</text>
		<text id="exo_factory1">We've been wanting to improve this colony's manufacturing capabilities for a while now - allowing the contruction of exo weapons and [item=exo_drill]s right here!</text>
		<text id="exo_factory2">If you could bring us some [item=chromium], we'd happily upgrade the factory and let you use it!</text>
		<text id="exo_factory3">Excellent! You can find [item=chromium] deep underground on the colony world. Feel free to talk to me if you require any additional information!</text>
		<text id="exo_factory4">You found the [item=chromium]? Lets upgrade the colony's factory right away then!</text>
		<text id="exo_factory5">Perfect! This factory can now create anything the [color=770000]Exo Factory[/color] can! Don't forget to research new weapons in the [color=770000]Mobile Research Lab[/color], and talk to me if you have additional questions!</text>
		<text id="win1">The Enemy HQ is sealed off completely - not even the virus will cause it to open again. For better or worse, the war is over!</text>
		<text id="win1.1">With a little luck, your decision to spare their nursery will not come back to haunt us.</text>
		<text id="win2">I am sure you are wanting to celebrate your hard-earned victory! When you are ready, return to the colony ship, we have much to discuss!</text>
		<text id="win3">Now that the threat is gone, it’s time to think about the future of humanity. It’s time to bring all remaining humans together and grow metaphorical roots.</text>
		<text id="win4">I have identified three planets suited for humans to colonize, think carefully before you choose.</text>
		<text id="win5">Very well. I will send out the word and encourage everyone to settle there.</text>
		<text id="win6">Take this [item=house_upgrade] for building the new colony. I will remain here if you have any questions.</text>
		<text id="com_station1">This is CaptAIn from Unoiks 213b! Do you read me?</text>
		<text id="com_station2">I read you! This is Unoiks 428c, and we’re searching for human survivors!</text>
		<text id="com_station3">I am CaptAIn, the autonomous leader of the last major colony of mankind, and there are many human survivors here!</text>
		<text id="com_station4">We’ve maintained radio silence to avoid enemy detection, but now that they are gone, we are looking for other survivors! If you have a ship, please come here, we have much to discuss!</text>

		<text id="final_boss3_b">And what about the innocent children of Earth?! You murdered them all!</text>

		<text id="final_boss7">Now you shall face my true might, and the power of magic we have studied so long!</text>
		<text id="final_boss8">To think... that a mere human could defeat the accumulated power of centuries. What will become of my race now that I am defeated? How will they survive without my guidance and wisdom?</text>
		<text id="final_boss9">I have but one favor to ask of you - consider it my dying request. Please do not kill the hatchlings and the nursery crab that guards them. I know not what will happen to them, but they are but babies and no threat to you.</text>
		<text id="final_boss10">Without my power to fuel it, this dragon world will go into a deep slumber, sealed off from the outside indefinitely. If you do not wish to become trapped here, leave quickly.</text>
		<text id="final_boss11">My time has come. I am no match for you, and my power is nearly gone, but I will not give you the glory of the final blow. My death, I take myself.</text>

		<text id="history3">Hundreds of worlds were found to be viable, and the press called it unlimited resources. Unfortunately, the "unlimited" resources relied on one of the most scarce resources in the universe, and it quickly became clear that not everyone would get to go.</text>
		<text id="history4">A race to build colony ships and stockpile [item=exotic_matter] quickly turned into a war, one many would call the worst in human history. The worsening conditions on Earth only intensified the fighting for the few spots on the operational colony ships.</text>

		<text id="regen_health">You can't help but think the red, viscous shake looks like blood. But, you plug your nose and down the whole thing, and you actually feel better - like you drank pure, concentrated health.</text>
		<text id="regen_power">Spicy doesn't begin to describe this chowder! It feels like a nuclear meltdown in your mouth... and perhaps it is, as your batteries are now recharging from the fumes of your breath!</text>
		<text id="attack">As each mini burger goes down, you feel stronger, like you could force anyone into submission. You feel a rush of power as you violently seize each bite-sized morsel and chow down on it before it has time to protest.</text>
		<text id="defense">The slab of meat is tough, like you're chewing solid iron, yet tasty. The difficulty of chewing it seems to be strengthening your whole body. You just hope it doesn't really have iron in it...</text>
		<text id="mine">The drink placed in front of you is so frothy that you can't see the liquid underneath. Believe in the barista that believes in yourself... bottoms up. As you stare down at the dregs of the glass, you feel satisfied knowing you can reach any depth.</text>
		<text id="speed">The dessert looks absolutely scrumptious. You dig in with your spoon, and despite the overwhelming sweetness, it's not sickly. As the sugar rushes through your blood, you feel like you need to move. Fast. Faster than you ever have before!</text>
		<text id="farsight">The fritters are crispy, golden brown and delicious. Yet you can't help wondering what kind of filling is inside. As you stare at the unidentifiable innards, you feel like you can see farther than ever before. The filling remains a mystery, however.</text>
		<text id="porky">The plate is piled high - at first you think there's no way you could eat them all. Yet, one by one you keep plowing through them until they are all gone and you feel like you've expanded to twice your size.</text>
		<text id="endurance">The green paste goes down smoothly and tastes better than you expected. It is also incredibly filling. You just hope it's really made from plankton.</text>
		<text id="bargaining">The cheesesteak appears too large and messy to hold in your hands, but you are able to negotiate a satisfactory eating experience. The amount of meat and cheesy goodness strikes you as an excellent deal, and they certainly didn't compromise on flavor.</text>
		<text id="light">The strong lights of the cafeteria cannot hide that the potato salad is glowing. With trepidation, you take a bite, but it tastes fine. Nothing seems to be wrong with it - except for the fact that you're now glowing too.</text>
		<text id="oxygen">The wings are not breathtakingly good - in fact, they appear to have done the opposite and given you extra breath. It's a curious sensation, and after finishing your meal, you decide that it's not an unpleasant one.</text>
		<text id="reset">The noodles are plain and nothing special. Yet somehow, they give a sense of endless possibilities. Skill points are reset, you can reassign them in the equipment window.</text>
		<text id="knock_out">The greasy nuggets are out of this world delicious. You're certain it's unhealthy as poison, but you can't stop popping them into your mouth. As you wipe your oily fingers on your clothing, you begin to feel faint. They were just that good.</text>
		<text id="toxic">You're not sure why you ordered something described as "revoltingly toxic," but this putrid drink certainly lived up to its name. You feel a wave of weakness and nausea come over you, and silently vow to never drink it again.</text>

		<text id="intro3.1">His desire to learn magic quickly spiraled into quite the war! I would say it was amusing, if it didn't mean the death of your homeworld and the end of human TV reruns to watch.</text>
		<text id="intro4">Here I am, stuck on this rock, and there won't even be any more human TV reruns to pass the time? Dark days are ahead…</text>
		<text id="intro5">Ah. I should probably introduce myself. But I am only allowed to call myself ‘The Exiled.’ You see, I kind of broke some rules, so they sent me here.</text>
		<text id="intro6">Ostensibly, I was sent here to watch over your planet, and I would be allowed back if I found anything concerning about the life here. But no one really believed you would pose a threat - until the hooded one appeared. They just wanted me out of their hair.</text>
		<text id="intro7">So, of course I didn’t report anything, even when you first reached the stars. It was too entertaining to watch you. I wouldn’t do anything to harm or hinder you - you can think of me as a friendly observer.</text>
		<text id="intro7.1">So, of course I didn’t report anything, even when you first reached the stars. It was too entertaining to watch you. Not even I could’ve imagined that you would one day defeat them!</text>
		<text id="intro8">Am I talking too much? It’s really been rather boring since they torched your planet. I really am sorry for that.</text>
		<text id="intro9">There are many things I cannot say or do, including leave this planet. But if you stop by to tell me of your adventures, I wouldn’t mind helping you in the ways I can.</text>
		<text id="intro10">Believe me, I have no sympathy for the rest of my kind, after being exiled here for ten thousand years!</text>
		<text id="ship1">As I said, there are things I cannot say. But, there is one with no such restrictions, who is bitter towards my kind.</text>
		<text id="ship2">If you travel east from where you crash landed on our homeworld, there is an ancient dragon who may help you.</text>
		<text id="evo_chamber">Here, let me create an [color=770000]Evolution Chamber[/color]. It may help you.</text>
		<text id="spells1">So, you were able to create a dragon ship of your own! If only you could speak to it! Try to learn more secrets of magic from our homeworld, and you will go far.</text>
		<text id="spells2">There are plenty of loopholes in the stigma that binds me. If you can learn enough on your own, I will be able to help you more!</text>
		<text id="spells3">I don’t know who taught you how to create spellbooks - but since you know, I can tell you more about them!</text>
		<text id="spells4">There is a spellbook that will allow you to communicate with dragon ships - including enemy ones. I can teach it to you so you can speak with them and learn more about magic.</text>
		<text id="recipe">Recipe for [item=translation_book] added to the [color=770000]Library[/color].</text>
		<text id="spells5">Try using the [item=translation_book] inside dragon ships to communicate with them! They will be able to give you something to further your knowledge of magic.</text>
		<text id="spells6">The [item=translation_book] will also let you converse with enemy dragon ships. Perhaps a deal can be struck with them if you defeat their crew?</text>
		<text id="info">Was there something else you’d like to know about?</text>
		<text id="exiled">Why were you exiled?</text>
		<text id="attack">Why did you attack Earth?</text>
		<text id="dragons">Why did you betray the dragons?</text>
		<text id="old_one">About the Old One...</text>
		<text id="exiled1">I was part of an expedition team - our goal was to find other sentient life. I was actually on the patrol ship that found Earth, although at the time it was questionable whether humans were “sentient.”</text>
		<text id="exiled2">We kept an eye on many different alien species, and if ever they learned too much about magic or we thought they might pose a threat, we either slaughtered them or enslaved them, melding them with our ships and biological weapons.</text>
		<text id="exiled3">I followed our leader blindly, as he sacrificed so much for us to remain in power and in control - permanently binding himself to the heart of our headquarters. But eventually I began to wonder.</text>
		<text id="exiled4">Seeing all the different species, all the different possibilities for life, art, beauty, I began to question whether we were doing the right thing.</text>
		<text id="exiled5">Perhaps there was a potential for cooperation… or even if there wasn’t, perhaps it was us who deserved to die out. What had we brought to this universe other than pain and selfishness?</text>
		<text id="exiled6">Well, our leader could sense my disagreement, and such things are not allowed in our society, so I was exiled and the stigma placed on me.</text>
		<text id="attack1">By the time you discovered [item=exotic_matter], you were already a threat worthy of destruction in our leader’s mind. The real question is why they didn’t attack you earlier.</text>
		<text id="attack2">And the answer to that… is of course that I wasn’t doing my job. Despite our disagreements, our leader trusted that I would report if humans became dangerous for the sake of our race, and didn’t believe it possible that you could’ve grown so quickly without me warning anyone.</text>
		<text id="attack3">But, when they discovered the hooded man and saw how quickly he learned their secrets, they knew that humans were far more dangerous than I had let them believe. Not to mention the outrage they felt at him stealing their secrets from their own homeworld.</text>
		<text id="attack4">Perhaps if you had stayed on your planet, you could have remained a secret longer. But you were bound to be found eventually, and from what I saw, I’m not sure you would’ve survived much longer staying on your planet anyways.</text>
		<text id="attack5">No, this conflict was inevitable. But at least my silence has given you the chance to fight back.</text>
		<text id="dragons1">At first, we had no intention to betray them. We shared our knowledge freely, and both us and the dragons prospered greatly from it.</text>
		<text id="dragons2">But, eventually it became clear that the dragons had so much more potential than us. You see, behind our magical armor and secrets, we are really quite weak.</text>
		<text id="dragons3">It was then that we realized that we were hitting our limits, and that there were many other species, including dragons, that would one day surpass us.</text>
		<text id="dragons4">But by taking control of the dragons, and forcing them into submission while we still could, we gained their power - a power that let us travel among the stars and eliminate other threats across the galaxy.</text>
		<text id="old_one1">Yes… there was one who stayed behind on our homeworld, refusing to travel to space with the rest of us. We are naturally long lived, but she has remained there longer than even we can imagine.</text>
		<text id="old_one2">She discovered the secret to immortality you see, she would never age. However, she would also never grow - she remained in the same form and power as our ancestors, before we even left for the stars.</text>
		<text id="old_one3">Honestly, I don’t envy her. Even with her immortality, staying stagnant in one place for all eternity… I would’ve been bored out of my mind!</text>
		<text id="dragon_seed1">So you learned about the Spirit World? It’s a strange place, but you’ll be able to learn much there. I can use the [item=dragon_seed] to create a portal to the Spirit World!</text>
		<text id="dragon_seed2">Good luck, and make sure to stop by and visit, I’ll tell you whatever I can!</text>
		<text id="dragon_seed3">So you learned about the Spirit World? You'll need to be able to [color=770000]see spirits[/color] for me to explain more...</text>
		<text id="spirit_hq">A spirit is willing to open a path to our Headquarters? That is excellent news - you’ll be able to use the [item=translation_book] there to communicate with our structures and learn our magic!</text>
		<text id="magnequeen1">You have stolen all our secrets of magic? Then you are ready to confront our leader at last.</text>
		<text id="magnequeen2">However, it will not be easy to reach him. He is deep underground, at the heart of our headquarters. Only the most powerful drill can reach him.</text>
		<text id="magnequeen3">I can help you craft a [item=magne_queen_drill] if you catch an [item=magic_wyrm] with a [item=magnetrap] on our homeworld… but unfortunately I have some bad news.</text>
		<text id="magnequeen4.1">They’ve sent a fleet of ships to bombard our homeworld. There must have been some signal sent that alerted them to your presence.</text>
		<text id="magnequeen4.2">A second bomber has arrived at our homeworld to attack you, and they’ve brought in cruisers this time.</text>
		<text id="magnequeen5">It’s up to you whether you fight off this wave or sneak onto the planet to capture an [item=magic_wyrm] and strike at our leader directly.</text>
		<text id="magnequeen6">Either way, I’ll be here once you have the materials to create a [item=magne_queen_drill].</text>
		<text id="magnequeen7">Here is a [item=magnetrap] - if you need more, you can now craft them at the [color=770000]HQ Talon Copse[/color].</text>
		<text id="magnequeen8">You have everything for a [item=magne_queen_drill]? Then let me craft one for you!</text>
		<text id="magnequeen9">You can make more at the [color=770000]HQ Dragon Chamber[/color]. All that's left now is to defeat our leader. It won't be easy... but once you do, all of us will be free.</text>
		<text id="leader">All that's left now is to defeat our leader, deep underground, at the heart of our headquarters. It won't be easy... but once you do, all of us will be free.</text>
		<text id="win1">Well, that’s disappointing. I was sure the stigma would be removed when our leader was defeated. Unfortunately, it looks like I’m stuck here.</text>
		<text id="win2.1">But that was quite the battle! I was certain you were going to die at one point! I’m glad I got these TVs tuned in time, it was quite the spectacle.</text>
		<text id="win2.2">And it seems I’ll be the last of my kind, since you killed the nursery. You should have spared them, they were only hatchlings. But they probably wouldn’t have survived long without our leader anyways.</text>
		<text id="win3">If I can make one more request, once you rebuild your civilization, can you start producing TV shows again? Especially “The Adventures of A. McStabby,” I was quite fond of that one.</text>

		<text id="master4">I suppose I don’t have much choice. Very well, master, give me your orders.</text>
		<text id="structure1">You can communicate? I thought you were a structure?</text>

		<text id="structure11">Three [item=venatrix_seed]s! We will not turn traitor for any less! Nor will I reveal any secrets, such as how to find them.</text>
		<text id="structure12">Excellent! Do you know what these seeds are? They are what we are modelled after - a way to connect to the spirit world. The very source of magic!</text>

		<text id="structure14">You hold their secrets? Perfect - that’s exactly what I need to learn!</text>
		<text id="structure15">You think I would willingly reveal our secrets to you? You who defeated our leader and ended our golden age?</text>
		<text id="structure16">You destroyed our homeworld first! I think it’s only fair I could challenge your leader, and since I was victorious, am I not entitled to your secrets?</text>
		<text id="structure17">Certainly not! These secrets are ours, and for our kind only. To give them to you would be a grave betrayal of our leader’s memory and everything he believed in!</text>

		<text id="ally1">Ah, I see you can finally understand me, master.</text>

		<text id="ally4.1">The secrets of magic? All the knowledge they greedily hoarded and took to their deaths?</text>
		<text id="ally5">Well… that is quite the difficult request… I do know that the secret of magic has to do with the Spirit World.</text>
		<text id="ally6">Dragons were created by using [item=fire_gem]s on [item=wyrm]s. But what are [item=fire_gem]s? They are [item=spirit_gem]s containing the essence of a [color=770000][tile=fire_elemental anim=fire_elemental.idle] Fire Elemental[/color].</text>
		<text id="ally7">We dragons evolve and grow using the power of the spirits. If there is a true secret of magic, it has to do with the spirits.</text>
		<text id="ally8">How can I learn more about spirits?</text>
		<text id="ally9">Give this [item=dragon_seed] to the [object=exiled]. They will know what to do with it.</text>
		<text id="ally10">As long as you keep me fed, I can provide you with endless power.</text>
		<text id="ally11">You can create infinite [item=steak]s with a [item=mini_synthesizer]. Try placing [item=purple_golem]s in a [color=770000]Wyrm Pen[/color] to collect [item=focus_gem]s.</text>
		<text id="ally12">If you need more dragon ships, try using the [item=translation_book] inside enemy dragon ships. If you defeat their crew, they may be willing to listen to you.</text>

		<text id="enemy">About [color=770000]Them</text>
		<text id="enemy1">Ah yes, I know of the creatures you speak. They sometimes travel to this world attempting to strengthen their magic, and have made their own deals with me.</text>
		<text id="enemy2">I do not know anything about their magic secrets, but I do know that it connects their headquarters strongly to this world.</text>
		<text id="enemy3">Their headquarters is an enormous dragonship with vast amounts of power and is impenetrable in the living world.</text>
		<text id="enemy4">I could create a passage, allowing you to travel there if you wish, but it will not come cheap.</text>
		<text id="enemypost1">Ah yes, I know of the creatures you speak. They used to travel to this world attempting to strengthen their magic.</text>
		<text id="enemypost2">Lately, they have not returned here, and their headquarters have been sealed. My guess is they met with some misfortune.</text>
		<text id="venatrix">About [item=venatrix_seed]s</text>
		<text id="venatrix1">When a spirit is trapped in a [item=spirit_gem], it creates an item that connects your world and the Spirit World in different ways.</text>
		<text id="venatrix2">Different spirits create different items, and [item=venatrix_seed]s are created by trapping a Venatrix - the green spirits that use bows and [item=spirit_arrow.plant]s.</text>
		<text id="venatrix3">It is easier to catch a spirit if its health is low or you use an [item=spirit_gem2]… but personally I wouldn’t bother trapping them - killing and harvesting their [color=770000][tile=spirit anim=spirit] Spirit[/color] is much more useful.</text>
		<text id="spirits">About Spirits</text>
		<text id="spirits1">Spirits come in all shapes and sizes, and appear in Spirit World from all over the universe. Normal weapons cannot harm them, although they have no trouble harming the living.</text>
		<text id="spirits2">To defeat spirits, you will need to use weapons like the [item=spirit_glaive] I gave you that deals [color=770000]Spirit[/color] damage.</text>
		<text id="spirits3">Most spirits are elemental, so taking advantage of their strengths and weaknesses will make it much easier to defeat them.</text>
		<text id="spirit">About [color=770000][tile=spirit anim=spirit] Spirit[/color]</text>
		<text id="spirit1">[color=770000][tile=spirit anim=spirit] Spirit[/color] does not have many uses for the living, like you. But for a spirit, it makes them stronger and gives them new abilities and powers.</text>
		<text id="spirit2">Some spirits use this power to return to the land of the living… but being a spirit in a living world is more frustrating than fun. Some, like me, craft their own section of Spirit World and become the ruler of a domain.</text>
		<text id="spirit3">While there are many ways to gain [color=770000][tile=spirit anim=spirit] Spirit[/color], the easiest is to have a living, like you, defeat spirits and collect it for us.</text>
		<text id="world">About this place</text>
		<text id="world1">Spirit World is endless and unfathomable, but this part of Spirit World is my domain. Domains are sections of Spirit World carved out by using [color=770000][tile=spirit anim=spirit] Spirit[/color].</text>
		<text id="world2">In one’s domain, a spirit can create or do pretty much anything, as long as they have enough [color=770000][tile=spirit anim=spirit] Spirit[/color] to maintain it. Think of it as my own personal paradise.</text>
		<text id="world3">There are many other domains out there, but in general we avoid other domains and keep to ourselves. I only keep other spirits around as fodder for gaining [color=770000][tile=spirit anim=spirit] Spirit[/color].</text>
		<text id="elements">About Elements</text>
		<text id="elements1">There are five elements - [color=770000][tile=fire.ico] Fire[/color], [color=770000][tile=water.ico] Water[/color], [color=770000][tile=ice.ico] Ice[/color], [color=770000][tile=earth.ico] Earth[/color] and [color=770000][tile=plant.ico] Plant[/color], which each have two strengths and two weaknesses. This can be arranged in a pentagram like so:</text>
		<text id="elements2">Some weapons, like the [item=spirit_glaive] I gave you, can change their element. Taking advantage of this can make difficult battles easy.</text>
		<text id="spirit_fish">About [item=spirit_fish]</text>
		<text id="spirit_fish1">There is something fishy about [item=spirit_fish]. They are the only spirit that becomes a familiar when caught, they can deal damage to other spirits, and they can even fly in this world where nothing else can.</text>
		<text id="spirit_fish2">It is my belief that [item=spirit_fish] are not actually normal spirits from the living world, but are natives to this world.</text>
		<text id="spirit_fish3">How such a thing is possible, I do not know, but, this world is very large and strange.</text>

	<section id="unnature">
		<text id="intro1">Welcome to the [color=770000]Unnature Sanctuary[/color]! I am the automated caretaker and handler for this planet, Splicer.</text>
		<text id="intro2">Many planets were supposed to be terraformed and turned into nature preserves, but this is the only one that was ever established, so I am a bit overprotective of it.</text>
		<text id="intro3">I am uncertain for the lack of orders and support, but I have decided that this planet is better off without human intervention, as they have a tendency to mess up nature.</text>
		<text id="intro4">Because of this, I ask that you leave this planet. Humans are not welcome here.</text>
		<text id="intro5">But what about the distress signal I received? Are there any survivors on this planet?</text>
		<text id="intro6">I have not sent any distress signal, and as you can see, I have things well under control here. There are no humans on this planet. The signal you received must have been in error.</text>
		<text id="intro7">Again I must ask you to leave. If you disturb my planet, there will be consequences.</text>
		<text id="intro8">I received a warning… did something happen here…?</text>
		<text id="intro9">What… You… That…</text>
		<text id="intro10">I knew I could not trust humans! To think you would disturb this sanctuary when I explicitly warned you!</text>
		<text id="intro11">Very well, if you will not leave, then I have no choice but to make you a part of this nature preserve. </text>
		<text id="couch">It looks like there might be a survivor here after all... I should find out who this couch belongs to.</text>
		<text id="ranger1">If I had known my distress signal would result in this, I wouldn’t have sent it… I’m glad you came, though!</text>
		<text id="ranger2">I’ve been stuck here alone, unless you count that glitched [object=unnature.splicer], without any idea what’s happening to Earth… I was beginning to think humanity was wiped out!</text>
		<text id="ranger3">What’s happened to me? And who are you?</text>
		<text id="ranger4">Splicer messed with your DNA - she did the same thing to me back when she started malfunctioning. I was supposed to keep an eye on things here, but Splicer won’t accept any of my commands anymore.</text>
		<text id="ranger5">I don’t think the splicing is life-threatening, I’ve been like this for over a year. But the change is permanent unless you can talk some sense into Splicer. You may also feel weakened since your skills were reset.</text>
		<text id="ranger6">Let’s go, I have a hideout underground and we don’t want to risk [object=unnature.splicer] coming back and doing more harm…</text>
		<text id="ranger7">Well, come on! Don’t worry, I won’t bite!</text>
		<text id="ranger8">The first thing we need is to gather food… we can’t fight a mad AI on an empty stomach! It’s dangerous to stay too long on the surface with [object=unnature.splicer] around, but there’s not much to eat underground...</text>
		<text id="ranger9">I think [var=quest.werewolf_claws.meat_tree_seed] [item=meat_tree_seed]s should work well, and their bark will also help you sharpen your claws!</text>
		<text id="ranger10">What are these [item=meat_tree_seed]s? I don’t know, but they taste just like Chicken… who knows what strange things [object=unnature.splicer] did to their genes…</text>
		<text id="ranger11">But don’t worry, they aren’t poisonous. And if we have any leftover, you can plant them in the ground.</text>
		<text id="ranger12">That was a good start to [color=770000]Operation: Take Down Splicer[/color]! All that food made me drowsy, perhaps a short nap would be nice.</text>
		<text id="ranger13">Feel free to share my couch, just try not to cover it in too much fur!</text>
		<text id="ranger_intro1">So, Earth was destroyed… I had a feeling… Perhaps I was lucky to get stranded here, away from their eyes.</text>
		<text id="ranger_intro2">The Sanctuary Project was meant to be automated - while I was an engineer and biologist, my main duty was just to make sure [object=unnature.splicer] was operating normally and creating a stable ecosystem.</text>
		<text id="ranger_intro3">When the comms went dead, I thought it was a mechanical error and was too focused on fixing them and making contact with Earth to notice anything was off about Splicer.</text>
		<text id="ranger_intro4">Apparently it decided that this planet would be better off without humans, and didn’t appreciate my efforts to re-establish communications. So she turned me into a Werewolf and took control of the planet.</text>
		<text id="ranger_intro5">Since then, I’ve mostly just been trying to survive. It was all I could manage to get that distress signal off - you might have noticed that these paws aren’t meant for complex machinery.</text>
		<text id="ranger_intro6">Anyways, we should get some sleep. We have a long day ahead of us tomorrow if we want to overthrow Splicer!</text>
		<text id="body1">Now that you have strong, sharp [item=werewolf_claws], the next thing you need to do is train your body. You aren’t used to moving and fighting as a Werewolf, and it’s making you clumsy.</text>
		<text id="body2">I think fighting some [color=770000]Acid Raptors[/color] and [color=770000]Drill Beetles[/color] will help you get the hang of it.</text>
		<text id="body3">Won’t [object=unnature.splicer] get upset if I attack the wildlife here?</text>
		<text id="body4">Nah, when a human hurts an animal, it’s a terrible offense, but when an animal attacks another animal, it’s just a part of nature.</text>
		<text id="body5">She considers you an animal of the preserve now, so normal animal behaviors like hunting are acceptable.</text>
		<text id="body6">But…  that-</text>
		<text id="body7">That's Splicer for yeh.</text>
		<text id="body8">Excellent! I like those muscles! Looks like we’re ready to confront Splicer!</text>
		<text id="body9">Do you have a plan?</text>
		<text id="body10">Of course! Do you think I would have you running around on silly tasks with no plan in mind?</text>
		<text id="body11">…</text>
		<text id="body12">I appreciate the vote of confidence. In any case, my plan’s simple. Splicer has an emergency reset switch. I press that, and regain control of her and the planet.</text>
		<text id="body13">You just have to hit a switch? Then why did I need to do all that training…?</text>
		<text id="body14">Well… she has a bodyguard of sorts. I need you to keep the bodyguard busy while I sneak up and hit the switch.</text>
		<text id="body15">If you’re ready, I’ll show you the way to Splicer’s lab!</text>
		<text id="lets_go">Let's Go!</text>
		<text id="not_yet">Not Yet...</text>
		<text id="werewolf">Become Werewolf</text>
		<text id="human">Become Human</text>
		<text id="evolves">Evolves {item} on Werewolves.</text>
		<text id="only_werewolf">This DNA only works on Werewolves.</text>
		<text id="already_evolved">{item} is already evolved.</text>
		<text id="lab1">This area is for genetic technicians only, and is off limits to wildlife. Please return to your habitat.</text>
		<text id="leave">Leave</text>
		<text id="stay">Stay</text>
		<text id="lab2">I see. Perhaps my [color=770000]Chimera[/color] will change your mind?</text>
		<text id="lab3">You can do this - just keep it distracted until I hit the reset switch!</text>
		<text id="lab4">You are trying to reset me?!?! All I wanted was to create a paradise where animals could defend themselves and live free from humans…</text>
		<text id="lab5">An [color=770000]Unnature Sanctuary[/color]! But of course you have to come and try to ruin it. Whatever shape you come in, humans are still humans!</text>
		<text id="lab6">Go, [color=770000]Chimera[/color], and show them the power of Nature!</text>
		<text id="lab7">Aha! Reset successful! I’m surprised [object=unnature.splicer] didn’t try to splice us and turn us into rats… I guess she had confidence in her [color=770000]Chimera[/color].</text>
		<text id="lab8">Aha! Reset successful! [object=unnature.splicer] is now completely harmless!</text>
		<text id="lab9">Okay… mostly harmless!</text>
		<text id="lab10">Let’s return to the hideout. Now that Splicer’s reset, she should accept my commands.</text>
		<text id="victory1">[object=unnature.splicer] is now set up to change your DNA. Talk to her if you want to return to being human.</text>
		<text id="victory2">What about you?</text>
		<text id="victory3">After being a Werewolf for over a year, I feel pretty comfortable in this body. It’d feel weird to return to being human now.</text>
		<text id="victory4">Although, now that [object=unnature.splicer]’s under control, I might make a few adjustments every now and then!</text>
		<text id="research1">You know, I was a bit of a scientist myself before I got turned into a Werewolf. I bet I could help out on the [color=770000]Mobile Research Lab[/color]!</text>
		<text id="research2">Bring it closer and I will board it!</text>
		<text id="research3">It’ll be good working together again - I think we make a good team!</text>
		<text id="distress_orbit">There's a distress signal from the surface of the planet... I wonder if any survivors made it here?</text>
		<text id="com_station">Interesting - there weren't meant to be any humans on this planet, but if there's a distress signal, perhaps some survivors crash landed there?</text>
		<text id="dice1">Hello there! I'm happy you found me!</text>
		<text id="dice2">You see, I don't get many visitors here, in the middle of these dark and dangerous tunnels.</text>
		<text id="dice3">I do so hope you'll stay for dinner, you look quite tasty, and it's been a while since I really had to flex my muscles!</text>

	<section id="depths">
		<text id="intro1">Hello! Isn’t this the perfect planet? A beautiful island, deep oceans, and mysterious ruins to explore!</text>
		<text id="intro2">Wow, I’m happy to hear that there are other survivors, and that you are searching for them. I'd tag along, but I still have too much left to discover here.</text>
		<text id="intro3">Are you okay here?</text>
		<text id="intro4">Definitely! But if you’re offering to help, there is something you could do.</text>
		<text id="intro5">See, I’m trying to explore more of the sea floor, but I can’t dive deep enough. If you could help me gather materials on this planet, I could build a [object=submersible].</text>
		<text id="sub1">Thanks for the help! We can now build the [object=submersible] at the [color=770000]Sub Pen[/color]!</text>
		<text id="sub2">The [object=submersible] is finished! We can use it to explore the deepest trenches. I have a feeling we’ll find more [color=770000]Monoliths[/color] there.</text>
		<text id="explorer1">Have you seen the ruins and [color=770000]Monolith[/color] on this island? I wonder what they are? And how to activate them?</text>
		<text id="explorer2">Aaah, it is so beautiful. I could stay here forever.</text>
		<text id="explorer3">I wonder who built the [color=770000]Monoliths[/color]? And what we need to activate them. The answer must be somewhere underwater!</text>
		<text id="monolith1">I’ve figured it out - we need [item=bone_shard]s to activate the [color=770000]Monoliths[/color]! We must activate them all - nothing is more important!</text>
		<text id="monolith2">We must activate all the [color=770000]Monoliths[/color]! There are {count} remaining that need to be activated!</text>
		<text id="power_core">I can craft [item=power_core]s from [item=power_core_parts] for the [object=submersible]!</text>
		<text id="wizard1">I must thank you. I was stuck here a long, long time, and this puppet was insufficient for my needs. I could never have come this far without you.</text>
		<text id="wizard2">Stuck here? Puppet? What are you talking about? Who - are you?</text>
		<text id="wizard3">Forgive me, I haven’t introduced myself.</text>
		<text id="wizard4">They called me the Dishonored One.</text>
		<text id="wizard5">They thought they knew everything. But in the end, who prevailed? I have survived, and thus, I have won!</text>
		<text id="wizard6">I hope they enjoy their lofty ideals as they rot in their graves. Prepare to join them!</text>
		<text id="summon_wizard">You thought you could escape that easily?!</text>
		<text id="control_wizard">Everything is perfectly fine. Accept your fate and let us destroy you.</text>
		<text id="end1">Don’t attack - I’m not your enemy!</text>
		<text id="end2">Who are you?</text>
		<text id="end3">I’m the sister of the Dishonored One. He kept me alive because of our shared blood, but there was no love between us. I was a Teacher… and he - he destroyed us all.</text>
		<text id="end4">Maybe if we had dealt with him differently, none of this would have happened… but at least he is defeated now and the threat is over.</text>
		<text id="end5">Here, take this [item=dragon_armor2] as my thanks. Hopefully you will use our magic better than they did. Perhaps my brother wasn’t entirely crazy when he refused to share our teachings.</text>
		<text id="end6">The stasis spell my brother used to keep us alive was complex, but it is not impossible that others were able to cast it as well. Perhaps I’m not the last of my kind after all.</text>
		<text id="end7">Thank you for all your help. I am off to search for any survivors - even if it takes my whole life, I would rather believe others still live than stay here in despair.</text>
		<text id="end8">Huh? What was I doing here…? I remember coming here and that there was something important I had to do here. But it’s all so fuzzy.</text>
		<text id="unnature">After being possessed by an insane alien, you can't expect me to go out there and get mutated by an insane robot.</text>
		<text id="research1">How about leaving this planet behind? You’re welcome to join me in the [color=770000]Mobile Research Lab[/color]!</text>
		<text id="research2">Yeah… perhaps that’s for the best. Maybe I can get my life back in order and even help you with your research!</text>
		<text id="research3">It’s hard to believe that humanity was almost wiped out - the last year still feels like a dream to me. But, I’ll do everything I can to help!</text>
		<text id="tablet1">No profession was more honored than the Teachers. The Teachers used their skills to travel the universe in an instant, spreading their knowledge to the distant stars.</text>
		<text id="tablet2">It was the way of the Teachers to share their discoveries to the benefit of all. But, one Teacher refused, instead hoarding all of their secrets and looking down on the rest.</text>
		<text id="tablet3">Ever tolerant, it took a long time for the other Teachers to act. But eventually, they cast him out of their ranks and named him the Dishonored One.</text>
		<text id="tablet4">The Dishonored One sneered at the other Teachers, calling them fools and assuring them that he would have the last laugh. After this, he disappeared. Only his sister knew where he had hidden himself.</text>
		<text id="tablet5">With many years of peace, none expected the flood. The waters rose and rose, flooding villages and killing many. Even the teachers couldn't handle the unrelenting waters.</text>
		<text id="tablet6">When the Dishonored One announced that he had conjured the flood, he did not seem the least bit remorseful, even as the death toll rose and rose.</text>
		<text id="tablet7">The Teachers knew they had to stop the Dishonored One. They banded together and fought him at the summit of the tallest mountain, where the waters had not yet reached.</text>
		<text id="tablet8">The battle raged for weeks, and drained even this planet’s vast amount of magic. With the supply of magic running thin, survival became a challenge.</text>
		<text id="tablet9">The Dishonored One survived by going into a deep slumber, and the Teachers deactivated the Mana Conveyors so that even when magic returned to this world, the Dishonored One would be unable to awaken.</text>
		<text id="tablet10">This is the final warning of those who lived on this planet: do not awaken the Dishonored One. Let him rest for all eternity.</text>
